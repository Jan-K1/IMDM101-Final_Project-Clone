Immersive Media Design 101 - Final Project - Medieval Escape Room

The project focuses on a first person character who wakes up in a dungeon in a medieval setting. 
The character interacts with certain characters and objects to escape, while simultaneously uncovering a larger plot within the kingdom.

The project serves to help practice basics of Unity while also incorporating game design principles and scripting with C#.
